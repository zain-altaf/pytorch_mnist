This pytorch implementation was part of assignment 2 for course syde 577. In this assignment, an initial exploration of augmentation hyperparameters was done to find what was helpful and what value ranges worked well. Subsequentlly, using the chosen augmentation hyperparameters, optuna trials were run to obtain optimal hyperparameters in order to get a test accuracy greater than 99%.
